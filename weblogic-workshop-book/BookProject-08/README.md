# WebLogic Workshop Book Chapter 8 Sample

This directory contains samples from a chapter on using WebLogic Workshop's "advanced" included controls -- those designed to access J2EE features such as EJBs and JMS.

A goal of the WebLogic Workshop team was a to make developing J2EE applications easier by masking, where possible, code that wasn't part of client logic. So with the EJB control, for example, it was unnecessary to navigate the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). The controls also brought the consistent configuration model used across controls, making the gestures for configuring an EJB client similar to those for configuring a JMS client.

Chapter 8 was called, "Using the Advanced Controls".
