# Samples

This repository contains sample code connected with projects I've participated in. 

Generally, the code in these directories is "for display purposes only". That is, it is intended to be a view-only snapshot -- I haven't included the context and peripheral files needed for the code to run.

## api-baas

The [`api-baas`](api-baas) directory contains three samples illustrating roughly the same functionality in the Apigee API BaaS product (slated for EOL in June 2019). Each sample is coded to use an API BaaS SDK supporting a particular mobile platform -- Android, IOS, and JavaScript.

API BaaS is a NoSQL data store. The samples were designed to illustrate how you could use API BaaS as a backend by incorporating the SDKs into your mobile apps.

These samples are snapshots from code I wrote in 2013; they each have later versions running on later SDKs. API BaaS lives on as the open source project [Usergrid](http://usergrid.apache.org/).

## extension-dev-kit

The [`extension-dev-kit`](extension-dev-kit) directory contains code illustrating how to extend the WebLogic Workshop development environment. 

Using the two kits, developers could develop custom artifacts (such as custom controls) or extend the WebLogic Workshop IDE, which was based on Java Swing.

## weblogic-workshop

The [`weblogic-workshop`](weblogic-workshop) directory contains three samples from a book I co-authored in 2003: [WebLogic Workshop: Building Next Generation Web Services Visually](https://www.amazon.com/BEA-WebLogic-Workshop-Building-Generation/dp/076451797X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1536104874&sr=).

These samples illustrate (for Workshop developers) how to use J2EE features, write web service client code, use JavaScript (via E4X) to manipulate XML.

WebLogic Workshop began as an IDE for building SOAP-based web services. The samples here require WebLogic Workshop 7.1, which is almost surely no longer available.
