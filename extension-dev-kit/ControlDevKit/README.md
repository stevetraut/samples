# Control Developer's Kit

The control developer's kit was an SDK designed to help Java programmers extend WebLogic Workshop by creating their own custom controls for use in the IDE. In WebLogic Workshop, controls encapsulated functionality so that a web service developer could more easily add features to a service. A control could encapsulate access a data store or other resource. Developing a custom control meant writing its logic in Java, but also adding support for design-time properties, user interface, and so on.

The kit included:

- [ControlFeatures](ControlFeatures) -- A set of folders which each contain code illustrating a particular aspect of custom control development.
- [ControlTest](ControlTest) -- A set of SOAP web services (implemented as WebLogic Workshop .jws files) that illustrate how the sample controls in this kit work.
