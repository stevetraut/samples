# Extension Dev Kit

This repository contains sample code for the Extension Dev Kit released to support WebLogic Workhop. The kit was designed to support developers who wanted to extend Workshop by developing custom artifacts (such as custom controls) or extend the Workshop IDE.

The kit included:

- [ControlDevKit](ControlDevKit) -- Code illustrating how to implement support for features for custom code that presented that code in a manner similar to the included Workshop features. For example, the kit code illustrates how to raise callback events, present a wizard for adding a new control, present a property editor, and so on.
- [IdeDevKit](IdeDevKit) -- Code illustrating how to extend the WebLogic Workshop IDE. Samples included here illustrate how to support a custom project type, support drag-and-drop, present a dockable frame view, present a custom menu item, and so on.
