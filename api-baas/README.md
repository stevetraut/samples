# API BaaS Samples

Each of the samples here illustrates a similar set of functionality, but each uses a different SDK. The samples add, list, and manage users and user groups in the API BaaS data store.

Apigee API BaaS is a mobile backend-as-a-service (BaaS) with a NoSQL data store. In addition to exposing a RESTful API, it includes several SDKs to support mobile platforms.

These samples are snapshots from code I wrote in 2013 while writing documentation for API BaaS. Each sample has later versions available in later SDKs. Scheduled to EOL in June 2019, API BaaS continues as the open source project [Usergrid](http://usergrid.apache.org/).
