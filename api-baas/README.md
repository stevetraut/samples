# API BaaS Samples

API BaaS is a NoSQL data store designed to support mobile apps. In addition to exposing a RESTful API, it includes several SDKs for native access from mobile devices.

Each of the samples illustrates essentially the same set of functionality with different SDK -- adding, listing, and managing users and user groups.

These samples are snapshots from code I wrote in 2013; they each have later versions running in later SDKs. API BaaS continues as the open source project [Usergrid](http://usergrid.apache.org/).
