# API BaaS Samples

Apigee API BaaS is a NoSQL data store designed to support mobile apps. In addition to exposing a RESTful API, it includes several SDKs for native access from mobile devices.

Each of the samples here illustrates a similar same set of functionality with a different SDK -- adding, listing, and managing users and user groups in the API BaaS data store.

These samples are snapshots from code I wrote in 2013; they each have later versions running in later SDKs. Scheduled to EOL in June 2019, API BaaS continues as the open source project [Usergrid](http://usergrid.apache.org/).
